  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    This is the main demo page of the Django photo album sample application of Cloudinary.<br />
    Here you can see all images you have uploaded to this application and find some information on how
    to implement your own application storing, manipulating and serving your photos using Cloudinary!
  </p>
  <p>
    All of the images you see here are transformed and served by Cloudinary.
    For instance, the logo and the poster frame.
    They are both generated in the cloud using Cloudinary's shortcut functions.
    These two pictures weren't even have to be uploaded to Cloudinary, they are retrieved by the service, transformed, cached and distributed through a CDN.
  </p>

  <h1>Your Images</h1>
  <div class="photos">
    <p>
      Following are the images uploaded by you. You can also upload more pictures.

      You can click on each picture to view its original size, and see more info about and additional transformations.
